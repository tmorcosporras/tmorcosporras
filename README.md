# Welcome to my page!
### Introduction
I'm Tomás, a 20-year-old computer science student and aspiring developer from Córdoba, Argentina.

As of writing this, I'm learning Python and HTML.

I work on an Ubuntu PC.

### Personality
I'm a very curious, creative and outgoing person, with a focus on logic and problem solving.

I love talking about science, humanities and really anything, I seek every opportunity to learn new stuff!

I strive to listen to and validate my fellows' experiences and I'm the first to recognise my shortcomings.

I like to follow precise, clear directives, I tend to interpret orders as set in stone, though I may ask for clarification and suggest alternatives.

These traits in conjunction make me particularly inclined towards teamwork.
